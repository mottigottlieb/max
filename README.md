MAXOUT is a computer program made with Sinatra as part of an assessment for Learn Verified. 

MAXOUT tracks the maximum weight and the repetitions for this weight of all exercises performed during a workout session. Users can add new exercises to each session and edit the sessions. 

All the sessions are saved so that users can look back on their progress. # max
